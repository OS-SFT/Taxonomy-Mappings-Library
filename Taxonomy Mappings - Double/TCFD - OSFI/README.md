## Summary Observations

- OSFI's mandatory climate-related financial disclosures align with the international TCFD framework. These disclosures will incentivize improvements in the quality of the institutionsâ€™ governance and risk management practices related to climate.
- In doing so, this contributes to public confidence in the Canadian financial system by increasing transparency. This also aligns with a commitment made by the federal government to require financial institutions to publish climate disclosures starting in 2024.
