# Mapping: TCFD - CSRD - SFDR - Supply Chain

## Project Summary

Mapping including the TCFD recommendations, NFRD/CSRD requirements, SFDR Principal Adverse Impact disclosures, and an example internal supply chain emissions inventory.

## Summary Observations

Please see [here](https://vimeo.com/user188894913/esg-carbon-emissions) for a video explanation of the example model of a T-shirt supply chain and its CO2e calculation. This model was developed by OS-SFT Contributing Partner Solidatus, to illustrate what is included in the calculations for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions for a sample company.

# Further Commentary

The taxonomy mapping model above was built sequentially, beginning with a mapping between the TCFD recommendations and the original NFRD framework. With NFRD being replaced by CSRD, exposure draft E1 (Climate Change) of the ESRS drafted by EFRAG was used to represent the key disclosures required by companies under EU regulation. To demonstrate how this data will flow into the sustainability disclosures of financial institutions, the CSRD was mapped to the Principal Adverse Impact disclosures which are asset managers will be required to report for their investment portfolios.

The intermediate stages of model development can be viewed at the following links:

- [TCFD - NFRD - CSRD](https://os-sft.solidatus.com/viewer/share/R8qzer0NLxuB2KNiKP2PdoaM8wfQRAHJ)
- [TCFD - NFRD - CSRD - SFDR](https://os-sft.solidatus.com/viewer/share/2wzrseOpSTd6O3LjtDm3K78OYbldKeBg)

Linking this flow to the example supply chain model gives an idea of how CO2 emissions calculations for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions will help both companies and investors meet their reporting obligations, under both EU and global regulations and frameworks.
