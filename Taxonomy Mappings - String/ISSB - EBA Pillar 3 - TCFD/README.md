## Summary Observations

* Regarding the General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information (IFRS S1), the EBA agrees with the objective to disclose sustainability related financial information that is useful when assessing enterprise value. However, the EBA has suggested clarifying the definition and application of materiality in general, especially regarding financial materiality, location of information, disclosure of the sustainability-related impacts and definition of the value chain.
In relation to Climate-related Disclosures (IFRS S2), the EBA has recommended enhancement and clarification. For example, the requirement for entities to disclose GHG emission reduction targets separately from the use of carbon offsets, and to disclose offsets which are certified, should be structured in a clear way.

* The EBA has also called on the ISSB and TCFD to closely cooperate with each other during the finalisation of their own consultations, so as to ensure greater comparability between EU companies and the companies outside of the EU which will be adopting the international standards. In light of the requirements set out in its draft ITS on Pillar 3 ESG risks, the EBA also stressed the importance of enhancing the disclosure of corporates’ transition plans and of standardising the climate change-related metrics, so as to ensure the comparability and quality of their disclosures.

* ISSB enhances both TCFD and EBA Pillar 3 to create a sort of Gold Standard for sustainability reporting. The proposals build on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and incorporate industry-based disclosure requirements derived from SASB Standards. The consultations end on July 29, 2022, with ISSB planning to review the feedback in the second half of 2022 and issue the final standards by year-end.

## Further Commentary

The proposed IFRS standard on climate-related disclosure requirements, based on the TCFD Recommendations, sets out the specific requirements for the identification, measurement, and disclosure of climate-related financial risks and opportunities and includes disclosure of information on:

* The governance processes, controls, and procedures a company uses to monitor and manage climate-related risks and opportunities.
* How climate change could reasonably be expected to affect a company's business model, strategy, and cash flows over the short, medium, or long term; its access to finance; and its cost of capital.
* Climate-related physical and transition risks and opportunities including how a company plans to achieve any climate-related targets, how it expects to adapt to or mitigate climate-related risks, and whether carbon-offsetting is part of its plan.
* Use of climate-related scenario analysis to assess a company's risks and opportunities and disclose how its climate-related analysis aligns with the latest international agreement on climate change.
* How significant climate-related risks and opportunities have affected a company's most recently reported financial position, financial performance, and cash flows and how this may affect the company's financial position over time, given its strategy to address significant climate-related risks and opportunities.
* How processes to identify, assess, and manage climate-related risks and opportunities are integrated into the company’s overall risk management processes.
