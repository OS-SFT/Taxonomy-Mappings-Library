## Summary Observations

- EBA Pillar 3 ESG Disclosures are guided by three tables and ten templates, describing the qualitative and quantitative disclosure requirements respectively.
- Quantitative requirements relate to banking book exposures to physical and transition climate risks.
- Qualitative disclosures are categorised as Environmental, Social or Governance related.
- There is a significant degree of overlap between EBA Pillar 3 ESG disclosure requirement and ISSB S2 disclosure requirements, with various potential proxy approaches identified based on the EBA's Green Asset Ratio (see detailed research [below](https://github.com/FD-SustainableFinance/RESEARCH-EBA-PILLAR-3-ESG-RISK-DISCLOSURES/#further-commentary)).

# Further Commentary

The European Banking Authority (EBA) is a regulatory agency of the European Union headquartered in Paris. Its activities include conducting stress tests on European banks to increase transparency in the European financial system and identifying weaknesses in banks' capital structures. Following the recent updates to the regulatory frameworks for credit institutions and investment firms, and the publication in 2018 of the European Commission’s action plan on sustainable finance, the EBA is implementing a new policy strategy on institutions’ Pillar 3 disclosures that seeks to increase efficiency of institutions’ disclosures and reinforce market discipline by developing a comprehensive framework with consistent and comparable disclosures.

-	The EBA intends to encourage institutions to improve their management of Environmental, Social, or Governance (ESG) risks while also raising awareness of their crucial role in the shift to a green economy.
-	By establishing mandatory and uniform disclosure requirements, including granular templates, tables, and accompanying instructions, the EBA ESG Pillar 3 will aid in addressing the weaknesses of institutions' current ESG disclosures at the EU level. Additionally, it will support the development of worldwide best practises.
-	The draft would provide equivalent quantitative disclosures on physical and transition risks associated with climate change, as well as information on exposures to assets with a carbon footprint and assets vulnerable to both chronic and acute climate change events.
-	The draft contains KPIs on the assets of the institutions that finance environmental sustainability-related activities as defined by the EU taxonomy (GAR and BTAR), such as those in line with the objectives of the European Green Deal and the Paris Agreement.
-	The proposal offers detailed information on the ways that institutions are incorporating ESG factors into their frameworks for governance, business model, strategy, and risk management.

# Green Asset Ratio

Green Asset Ratio (GAR) key performance indicator (KPI) under the Taxonomy Regulation shows the proportion of exposures related to Taxonomy-aligned activities compared to the total assets of those credit institutions. To represent the amount to which these institutions finance Taxonomy-aligned activities, the GAR should be related to the primary lending and investing operations of the credit institutions, including loans, advances, and debt instruments as well as their equity holdings. The GAR classifies both qualified and aligned green assets according to the EU's taxonomy for sustainable operations, measuring "green assets" as a percentage of a bank's overall assets.

From the outset, one would assume that the calculation of GAR would be simple. However, difficulties include categorising exposures to calculate it, misreporting it and the way banks identify a way to utilise it as the world adjusts to the new age of climate sustainability. 
More precisely:
-	Banks will need to carefully examine how they construct their GAR disclosures due to data limitations and restrictions on the scope of the GAR calculation. For example, how they provide a picture to investor of how green they can be
-	GAR has huge potentially to maximise balance sheets. This metric, however, can make it difficult to exactly determine the value of a balance sheet, especially if it effects the cost of funding and credit ratings.
-	The GAR adds to a long line of measures requiring banks to collect information on customers and counterparties that are affected by the climate. Banks should avoid handling these obligations in silos and instead place the data needs for the GAR in the larger strategic context of other sustainability-related regulations, such as TCFD disclosures.
-	In order to complete this study, banks must consider their product strategy. The future trajectory of the market for green goods is still unknown. However, it is likely that green products will become increasingly popular in order to make real progress toward the climate transition, to reach objectives like net zero, and to satisfy growing customer demand. To be following the EBA Guidelines on Loan Origination and Monitoring, EU banks must apply ESG considerations to every step of the loan origination process, including pricing. Banks now have an extra incentive to boost their loans to Taxonomy-aligned operations as a result of the GAR's adoption.

Banks should see the GAR has a motivation and chance to enhance their balance sheet and product strategies. Banks should also establish an effective and consistent climate data model, and boost the legitimacy of their publicly announced net zero intentions.
