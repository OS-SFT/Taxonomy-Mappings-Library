The TNFD nevertheless strongly encourages report preparers to report all indicators relevant to the organisation, including the core disclosure metrics outlined in this guidance, to demonstrate alignment with global policy goals. 
An organisation should distinguish in their disclosures which pieces of material information are primarily relevant to specific stakeholder groups, such as investors and civil society.
The organisation should also consider describing:
- How it has defined the threshold to determine which topics are material for reporting; whether it has tested its selection of material topics with investors and 
other stakeholders; the sources, evidence and methods used to justify the naturerelated material information to be disclosed and any assumptions and subjective 
judgements made; 
- The stakeholders and experts who have informed the materiality determination process;
- Any limitations or exclusions. This could include the time periods considered for assessing the effects of decisions and actions, or if some categories of business relationships from certain parts of the value chain have been excluded when identifying material topics; and
- How it has prioritised the effects of its decisions and actions for reporting."

Qualitative information may include how naturerelated risks and opportunities are considered in client 
selection, client advice, and product and service offerings. 
For example:
- An insurer could describe how nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities in its value chain affect the insurance offerings or insurer investments on a sector or at a geographic level;
- A bank could describe how its loan due diligence has been affected by the consideration of the borrower’s nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities;
- An asset manager or asset owner could describe how nature-related dendencies, impacts, risks and opportunities are factored into product development and investment or ownership strategy. Where possible, this information should reflect:
- The interconnectedness of nature and climate-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities, - The organisation’s strategy and responses to those dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities, and 
- How nature-related risks and opportunities are prioritised in the organisation’s strategy determinations. Financial institutions that have set commitments and/or have developed transition plans to support a shift of financial flows to align with the goals of the Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (to help achieve Targets 14 and 15) and/or other international environmental treaties should outline how those commitments and plans are set and implemented,and how progress is tracked. See also the guidance for disclosure recommendation Metrics and Targets C on target setting. It is recognised that for both qualitative and quantitative information, financial institutions have a reliance on disclosures from non-financial corporates or other tools, and that this may limit what a financial institution is able to disclose in the short to medium term. A financial institution should describe these limitations and its strategy to improve the information and analysis over time.
It is further recognised that there may be limitations on the granularity of information disclosed due to confidentiality and/or competitive reasons. A financial institution should disclose information at the greatest level of granularity that is practical while respecting these constraints."

It is recognised that disclosing an investee or client’s nature-related dependencies and impacts associated with financial activities is different from assigning responsibility to the financial institution for contribution to those impacts and dependencies. Nevertheless, consistent with the OECD Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises and the specific financial sector guidance, actions that can be taken by financial institutions to encourage mitigation of the impacts and dependencies of investees/clients should be pursued and aligned with the concepts in the OECD Guidelines.

This could include the costs incurred from mitigating or adapting to naturerelated risks, such as relocating operations, or revenue from products and services that have positive impacts on nature Over time, indicators and metrics should be provided for historical periods to allow for trend analysis. Where appropriate, an organisation should provide forwardlooking nature-related indicators and metrics, consistent with its business or strategic planning time horizons. In addition, an organisation should provide a description of the methodologies and assumptions used to calculate or estimate nature-related indicators and metrics, including any limitations.
Where nature-related issues are material, organisations should describe whether and how related performance metrics are incorporated into remuneration policies."

For any metric reported, the overall purpose for the metric, methodologies used, including its limitations (e.g. scope covered, assumptions made and data availability), and the quality of data should be disclosed. It is recognised that financial institutions have a reliance on disclosures from non-financial corporates or other tools for both qualitative and quantitative information, so there may be limitations to what financial institutions are able to disclose.
Financial institutions should consider the global core metrics for dependencies and impacts for their direct operations as well as their financial portfolios. In many cases, the metrics may not be material for direct operations. Financial institutions should state this as part of the comply or explain approach.
Dependency – see Metrics and Targets recommended disclosure B.
Impact – see Metrics and Targets recommended disclosure B.
Risk – for financial institutions, these are metrics used to assess the potential for loss due to nature-related risks specifically. These could include potential losses on lending and advisory for banks, underwriting for insurers or investments for asset managers and owners. These will often be scenario based and the measures or outputs disclosed may depend on the scenario applied for a given sector or geography. Risk metrics can be disclosed for specific portfolios, portions of portfolios or the organisation as a whole. The scope of the exposures examined and methods applied should be clearly stated. 
Opportunity – for financial institutions, these are metrics used to track nature-related opportunities specifically. These could include lending and advisory opportunities for banks, underwriting opportunities for insurers or investment opportunities for asset managers and owners. These will often be in the form of individual products or transactions, so can be disclosed as absolute amounts or relative to a portfolio total. The scope and methods applied should be clearly stated."

This should include the following:- Material business impact drivers connected to the priority locations identified in Strategy A and D where possible, and with reference to the relevant change to the state of nature. This should include quantification of the global core and additional impact and dependency disclosure metrics in Annex 1, and sector and biome-specific metrics in Annexes 4 and 5. An organisation should consider describing any interconnections between dependencies and impacts, such as where it has an impact on an ecosystem on which it also depends;- External trends affecting the state of nature in ecosystems in priority locations that the organisation depends on, where feasible. Organisations could also consider quantifying external trends, referring to the indicators and metrics in Annex 1 and sector and biome-specific metrics in Annexes 4 and 5; - Whether and how the organisation assesses the condition and extent of the ecosystems in priority locations, with reference to the tools, data platforms, indicators and metrics used, and the science-basis for the link to response to nature-related risks and opportunities. Where the organisation is not currently measuring changes to the state of nature, the organisation should explain why this is the case and whether and how this will change in future periods. Organisations should also consider quantifying changes to ecosystem condition and extent in priority locations, referring to the additional metrics in Annex 1 and sector and biome-specific metrics in Annexes 4 and 5; - A description of the ecosystem services influenced by the organisation’s impact drivers in priority locations, including where changes to the ecosystem service may affect stakeholders; - A description of the dependencies on ecosystem services in priority locations by type of ecosystem, highlighting where dependencies are connected to organisation’s impact drivers; and - For ecosystem services that the organisation simultaneously has an impact on and depends on in priority locations, organisations should consider quantifying changes to the provision of the service, referring to the additional metrics in Annex 1 and sector and biome-specific metrics in Annexes 4 and 5.
Over time, metrics should be provided against historical baselines and reference states and/or industry averages for trend analysis. Where appropriate, an organisation should consider providing forward-looking nature-related indicators and metrics, consistent with its business or strategic planning time horizons.In addition, where not apparent, an organisation should provide a description of the methodologies and assumptions used to calculate or estimate nature-related indicators and metrics, including any limitations. An organisation should also describe the scope of the value chain(s) covered by the nature-related indicators and metrics."

Targets in scope include:
- Targets for changes to impact drivers; - Targets to improve or maintain the flow of ecosystem services;- Targets to improve or maintain the state of nature;- Targets for changes to business activities and processes correlated with dependencies and impacts;- Enterprise-level targets directly or indirectly affecting nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities. For example, business model changes that increase the circularity of the business or the traceable or certified share of the supply chain; and- Other targets to address nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks or opportunities.
In all cases, targets should be specific and timebound, quantified with metrics that can be suitably measured and relevant to the organisation’s strategy or risk management plans, including the pursuit of opportunities. 
Organisations should consider reporting the following:- Proportion of targets that address short-term, medium-term and long-term risks and opportunities;- Proportion of targets and commitments with time commitments in place; and - Proportion of targets that are time-bound and quantifable- Proportion of geographical sites/priority locations that are covered by targets.In preparing this disclosure, organisations may also refer to the TNFD’s additional guidance on target setting"
