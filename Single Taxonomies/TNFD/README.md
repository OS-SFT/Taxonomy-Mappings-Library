## Summary Observations
The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) is a framework for nature-related risk management and disclosure. It was designed to help organizations act and report on nature-related risks relevant to their direct and indirect operations. Established in 2021, the TNFD aims to assist in shifting the global financial system from one that exploits nature to one that supports and nourishes it

## Further Commentary
The TCFD focuses on documenting how an organisation affects the climate on a global scale. It aims to improve consistency and comparability among companies' climate-related disclosures. Better information, in the FSB's opinion, will enable businesses to take climate-related risks and opportunities into account when making risk management and strategic planning decisions. The ability of markets to direct investment toward sustainable and resilient solutions, opportunities, and business models will improve as businesses and investors alike improve their grasp of the financial consequences of climate change. The objective of the disclosure requirements under each category are as follows:

#### Governance:
* Explain how the board monitors climate-related threats and opportunities.
* Outline the function of management in identifying and addressing climate-related risks and opportunities.
#### Strategy:
* Describe the short-, medium-, and long-term climate-related risks and opportunities the organisation has identified. 
* Describe the impact of these risks and opportunities on the organization's operations, strategy, and financial planning.
* Highlight the resilience of the organization's strategy while considering various climate-related scenarios.
#### Risks:
* Elucidate the organization's methods for recognising and evaluating climate-related threats.
* Describe the organization's procedures for mitigating hazards associated with the climate.
* Explain the methods used to incorporate climate-related risk management into the organization's overall risk management.
#### Metrics and Objectives:
* Declare the metrics that the organisation uses to evaluate opportunities and hazards connected to climate change in accordance with its strategy and risk management procedure.
* Disclose the risk associated with Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if applicable, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
* Describe the objectives that the organisation uses to manage opportunities and risks connected to climate change, as well as performance against targets.
