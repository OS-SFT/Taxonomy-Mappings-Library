## Summary Observations

- Climate Risk as an entity has the capability to cause reduction in various asset categories. The impact of this change can resonate into credit risk and can therefore, play a major role in a how a firm makes it's financial decisions. As a result, it is impossible to measure the amount of exposure given a firm's position.
- The report used for constructing this taxonomy captures three important areas of risk:
  -  Physical Risks
  -  Transition Risks (related to adaption and mitigation)
  -  Natural Capital Risks
- Physical and Transitions risks are referenced in almost any collection of climate risk information and for convenience, the definitions of acute and chronic physical risks in this taxonomy are set in concrete. Transition adaptation costs also play a major role in this assignment. Even though Natural Capital risks are different to climate risks, they are exponentially having a negative impact that is driven solely by climate risk. Financial activity such as cash flows to profitability are susceptible to these risks and therefore any form of acceleration will originate from either depletion or disruption.
- When it comes to alignment with other taxonomies, the transition mitigation category has the least amount of validation from an external source. In other words, there are no other taxonomies where these risks are discussed in great detail. At present, the probability for GHG (greenhouse gases) seemingly increases while the main potential mitigation risk orginates from the regulatory front.
- The sole purpose of this taxonomy is to enable banks, investors and regulators to assess and review potential risks that are categorised as climate or natural capital. In this group, many of the risk indicators have a significant amount of uncertainty embedded in them.

# Detailed Research

## What are the past assessments of climate risk to firms?
-	Any climate risk taxonomy should address climate risks that have financial effects at the firm level or that may affect varying measures to financial performance. This taxonomy only addresses risks on a much smaller scale (ie.at the firm level) as opposed to an holistic scale (macro-economic level). The upside to this approach is that investment and financial decisions are made at the firm level. If a risk cannot be specified, it is impossible to quantify and price that climate risk.

## Defining Risk
- According to the reports, risks apply to both impacts and responses to climate risk. 

## What are climate physical risks?
- Banks are developing tools and methodologies to examine physical risk exposure in both corporate and retail settings. Factors such as data uncertainty and knowledge gaps always have an affect on the development of such these tools.
- There are two types of physical risk, acute and chronic
  - Acute physical risk refers to an event that causes a signifcant amount of physical damage (wildfires, flooding etc)
  - Chronic physical risk refers to those that carry a range of physical impacts that has a longer duration than those of acute risks (eg.multiyear drought)
    
## About transition risks
- This taxonomy appoints adaptation risk as a type of transition risk. Any form of change would cost money hence exposing firms to a wide range of costs is a very high possibility. Sometimes adaptation measures are not practical in come locations, but if they are, it can be extremely expensive to implement. These costs have a degree of uncertainty embedded in them hence they pose potential risks to certain financial measures.
- Adaptation costs are a broad range ost costs related to climate change impacts over a long period of time.
