## Summary Observations

- Climate Risk as an entity has the capability to cause reduction in various asset categories. The impact of this change can resonate into credit risk and can therefore, play a major role in a how a firm makes it's financial decisions. As a result, it is impossible to measure the amount of exposure given a firm's position.
- The report used for constructing this taxonomy captures three important areas of risk:
  -  Physical Risks
  -  Transition Risks (related to adaption and mitigation)
  -  Natural Capital Risks
- Physical and Transitions risks are referenced in almost any collection of climate risk information and for convenience, the definitions of acute and chronic physical risks in this taxonomy are set in concrete. Transition adaptation costs also play a major role in this assignment. Even though Natural Capital risks are different to climate risks, they are exponentially having a negative impact that is driven solely by climate risk. Financial activity such as cash flows to profitability are susceptible to these risks and therefore any form of acceleration will originate from either depletion or disruption.
- (Taxonomy alignment - will update this point)
- The sole purpose of this taxonomy is to enable banks, investors and regulators to assess and review potential risks that are categorised as climate or natural capital.

# Detailed Research

## What is the International Sustainability Standards Board and what is its remit?

-	The ISSB was founded by the IFRS Foundation at COP26 in Glasgow, November 2021.
-	Aims to develop standards that result in a comprehensive global baseline of sustainability disclosures focused on the needs of investors and the financial markets.
-	Standards to cover important sustainability topics (environmental, social, governance—ESG), beginning with climate, both on a thematic and industry-specific basis.
-	Will build on the work of existing reporting initiatives, incl:
    - Climate Disclosure Standards Board
    - Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
    - Value Reporting Foundation’s Integrated Reporting Framework
    - SASB Standards
    - World Economic Forum’s Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics
