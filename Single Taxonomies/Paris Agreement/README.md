## Summary Observations
The Paris Agreement is an international treaty on climate change. Adopted in 2015, the agreement covers climate change mitigation, adaptation, and finance. As of 2023, 195 members of the  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are parties to the agreement. The Paris Agreement's long-term temperature goal is to keep the rise in mean global temperature to well below 2 °C (3.6 °F) above pre-industrial levels, and preferably limit the increase to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F), recognizing that this would substantially reduce the effects of climate change. Emissions should be reduced as soon as possible and reach net zero by the middle of the 21st century.[3] To stay below 1.5 °C of global warming, emissions need to be cut by roughly 50% by 2030.

## Further Commentary
### Agreement Aim 

The aim of the agreement, as described in Article 2, is to have a stronger response to the danger of climate change; it seeks to enhance the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change through:

 (a) Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change;

 (b) Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development, in a manner that does not threaten food production;

 (c) Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.

Countries furthermore aim to reach "global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible." 

### Key Principles
#### NDC - Nationally Determined Contributions:

* A nationally determined contribution (NDC) or intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) is a non-binding national plan highlighting climate change mitigation, including climate-related targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions. These plans also include policies and measures governments aim to implement in response to climate change and as a contribution to achieve the global targets set out in the Paris Agreement.

* NDCs are the first greenhouse gas targets under the UNFCCC that apply equally to both developed and developing countries

#### ITMO - Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes:

* Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMO) are units from the new mechanism for the international emissions trading between Parties to the Paris Agreement. ITMO is a carbon emissions trading system where countries can purchase or trade carbon credits from other countries. Developed countries can lower the cost of meeting their own NDC by supporting less-costly emissions reductions in another country under the general heading of “internationally transferred mitigation outcomes”.
