## Summary Observations

From April until August 2022 EFRAG consulted on the first set of draft ESRS. Finalised versions – adopted through Delegated Acts by the European Commission – will constitute reporting requirements under the proposed CSRD. The European Commission will hold another consultation before adopting the first set of ESRS into legislation through delegated acts by June 2023.

The following draft ESRS were published for consultation:

- ESRS 1 - General principles
- ESRS 2 - General, strategy, governance and materiality assessment disclosure requirements
- ESRS E1 - Climate change
- ESRS E2 - Pollution
- ESRS E3 - Water and marine resources
- ESRS E4 - Biodiversity and ecosystems
- ESRS E5 - Resource use and circular economy
- ESRS S1 - Own workforce
- ESRS S2 - Workers in the value chain
- ESRS S3 - Affected communities
- ESRS S4 - Consumers and end-users
- ESRS G1 - Governance, risk management and internal control
- ESRS G2 - Business conduct

## EFRAG - Background

EFRAG’s mission is to serve the European public interest by developing and promoting European views in the field of financial reporting and ensuring these views are properly considered in the IASB standard-setting process and in related international debates. EFRAG ultimately provides advice to the European Commission on whether newly issued or revised IFRS meet the criteria in the IAS Regulation for endorsement for use in the EU, including whether endorsement would be conducive to the European public good. They released a series of proposed guidelines that would mandate reporting on different sustainability factors for tens of thousands of European firms that are not presently required to provide ESG disclosures. You an see the comparisons between EFRAG, IFRS, ISSB and IASB below as the financial and investor communities became aware of the importance of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) to better financial performance and avoidance of business risks, many reporting frameworks for key ESG metrics like GHG emissions started appearing.

**Extract**

"The objective of this [Draft] Standard is to set disclosure requirements that cover the information required by undertakings across all sectors (subject to the
rebuttable presumption in paragraph 57 of ESRS 1 General principles) in order to report under a double materiality perspective. It covers in particular:

- (a) the impacts (how the entity impacts climate change);
- (b) the actions and their results;
- (c) the material risks and opportunities arising from the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies. Such risks and opportunities are sources of financial
effects; and
- (d) the effects of risks and opportunities on the undertaking’s development, performance and position over the short-, medium- and long-term and therefore on its ability to create enterprise value (financial effects). 


[EFRAG](https://www.efrag.org/Assets/Download?assetUrl=%2Fsites%2Fwebpublishing%2FSiteAssets%2FED_ESRS_2.pdf) was formed to offer technical guidance to the European Commission on accounting-related issues. Additionally, it was tasked with contributing to the creation of IFRS sustainability standards. Its goal is to advance European perspectives on financial and sustainability reporting in the service of the public interest in Europe. The CSRD proposal, which would modify the current reporting requirements of the NFRD, was approved by the EU on April 21, 2021 as a component of the European Green Deal. The proposal designated EFRAG as the Commission's technical advisor in charge of creating the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS).

The European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) were released as a set of exposure drafts that outline reporting requirements across 13 EGS issues. The 13 ESG issues are categorized into four areas as follows:

* Cross-cutting: General principles, general, strategy, governance, and materiality assessment.
* Environment: Climate change, pollution, water and marine resources, biodiversity, resource use and circular economy.
* Social: Own workforce, workers in the value chain, affected communities, consumers, and end-users.
* Governance: Governance, risk management, internal control, and business conduct.
Compared to ISSB, EFRAG has a much more stakeholder lens. S, a variety of users want to see the devopment of a company's sustainability not just investors.
