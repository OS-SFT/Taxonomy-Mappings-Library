## Summary Observations

- The European ESG Template (EET) is a data exchange template to facilitate the exchange of environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related disclosures required by European financial markets legislation for investment funds.
- It is a standardised template that harmonises the way ESG-related data on financial products is exchanged and supports compliance with regulatory requirements.
- The EET has been developed as an industry initiative designed to standardise data exchange between banking, asset management, structured product, insurance, and pensions industries.

# Further Commentary

The EU SFDR sets out the fund disclosure requirements required to re-orient capital towards sustainable growth and help clients make better sustainable investing choices. 

The scope of the SFDR is relatively broad, applying to:

- Entities:
  - all financial market participants and financial advisers based in the EU,
  - investment managers or advisers based outside of the EU, who market (or intend to market) their products to clients in the EU under Article 42 of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (EU AIFMD).
- Products:
  - UCITS
  - AIFs
  - separately-managed portfolios and sub-advisory mandates
  - financial advice (provided within the EU or by an EU investment firm).

Under the SFDR Asset managers and advisers must disclose the manner in which they consider two key factors: Sustainability Risks and Principal Adverse Impacts. Subject to specific thresholds, asset managers are required to disclose their policies at both the firm and product level, while advisers are required to explain how they consider these factors in their advice.

- Sustainability Risks refer to environmental, social or governance events, or conditions, such as climate change, which could cause an actual or a potential material negative impact on the value of an investment.
- Principal Adverse Impacts are any negative effects that investment decisions or advice could have on sustainability factors. Examples could include investing in a company with business operations that significantly contribute to carbon dioxide emissions, or that has poor water, waste or land management practices.

SFDR currently specifies three distinct levels of disclosure for investment products with regards to sustainable investing and ESG considerations, under the following categorisations. The level of disclosure required increases depending on the degree to which sustainability is a consideration:

- “Article 6” products either integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk considerations into the investment decision-making process, or explain why sustainability risk is not relevant, but do not meet the additional criteria of Article 8 or Article 9 strategies.
- “Article 8” products promote social and/or environmental characteristics, and may invest in sustainable investments, but do not have sustainable investing as a core objective.
- “Article 9” products have a sustainable investment objective.
