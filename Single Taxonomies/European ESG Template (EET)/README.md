## Summary Observations

- The European ESG Template (EET) is a data exchange template to facilitate the exchange of environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related disclosures required by European financial markets legislation for investment funds.
- It is a standardised template that harmonises the way ESG-related data on financial products is exchanged and supports compliance with regulatory requirements.
- The EET has been developed as an industry initiative designed to standardise data exchange between banking, asset management, structured product, insurance, and pensions industries.
