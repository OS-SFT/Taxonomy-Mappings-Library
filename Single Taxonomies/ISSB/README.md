## Summary Observations

- The ISSB taxonomy was divided into three sections:
  - IFRS S1: General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information
  - IFRS S2: Climate-related Disclosures
  - IFRS S2: Industry-based Guidance on implementing Climate-related Disclosures
- ISSB aims to develop a comprehensive global baseline of sustainability disclosures. It is built on the recommendations of the TCFD and has absorbed various existing standards and frameworks including the IIRC, SASB, VRF and CBSD.
- Requirements under IFRS S1 are difficult to map to other existing frameworks given their generic nature. However, IFRS S2 and future topic specific standards will align more closely with frameworks addressing specific areas of sustainability.

# Detailed Research

## What is the International Sustainability Standards Board and what is its remit?

-	The ISSB was founded by the IFRS Foundation at COP26 in Glasgow, November 2021.
-	Aims to develop standards that result in a comprehensive global baseline of sustainability disclosures focused on the needs of investors and the financial markets.
-	Standards to cover important sustainability topics (environmental, social, governance—ESG), beginning with climate, both on a thematic and industry-specific basis.
-	Will build on the work of existing reporting initiatives, incl:
    - Climate Disclosure Standards Board
    - Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
    - Value Reporting Foundation’s Integrated Reporting Framework
    - SASB Standards
    - World Economic Forum’s Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics

## Key Proposals

The ISSB published two draft standards proposals in March 2022:

-	**Exposure Draft IFRS S1:** General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information
-	**Exposure Draft IFRS S2:** Climate-related Disclosures

The proposed S1 General Requirements would require companies to disclose information about all of their significant sustainability-related risks and opportunities.

S2 Climate-related Disclosures provides specific guidance on reporting climate-related risks and opportunities. It incorporates the recommendations of the TCFD and includes metrics tailored to industry classifications derived from the industry-based SASB Standards.

Company Approach to Reporting:

## S1 General Requirements

Core content is consistent with the TCFD Recommendations, with reporting requirements aligned to the TCFD structure:

|Governance|Strategy|Risk Management|Metrics and Targets|
|----------|--------|---------------|-------------------|
|Governance processes, controls and procedures the entity uses to monitor and manage sustainability-related risks and opportunities|The approach for addressing sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could affect the entity’s business model and strategy over the short, medium and long term|Processes the entity used to identify, assess, and manage sustainability-related risks|Information used to assess, manage and monitor the entity’s performance in relation to sustainability-related risks and opportunities over time|

-	S1 Requirements provide specific reportable items for each of the above, many of which are qualitative in nature or require some discussion and analysis.
-	Items are thematic/cross-industry only, i.e. there are no industry-specific reporting requirements.
-	Specific quantitative metrics are not required under S1 – these are to be required instead under S2 (climate) and further standards which relate to specific sustainability topics e.g. social and governance risk.

## S2 Climate-related Disclosures

Thematic/Cross-industry disclosure requirements are structured as above i.e. Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets.

S2 (Appendix B) also contains Industry-based disclosures, which are based on SASB Standards.
-	Disclosure requirements in Appendix B are marked up to reflect where they differ from the SASB Standards.
-	This will help identify crossovers/gaps between existing reporting by banks and the ISSB requirements.
-	Key exceptions to consistency with SASB relate to industries in the financial sector, to address risks from financed and facilitated emissions.

## S2 Industry-based Disclosures - Financial

In the initial phase, industry-based requirements for sectors B16 and B19 (commercial banks and mortgage finance respectively) were reviewed and compared with existing disclosure requirements under TCFD, SASB and EBA Pillar 3. Of the 11 industry-specific ISSB S2 metrics:

-	4 exist already under SASB
-	Another 4 exist under EBA P3
-	The remaining 3 are partly covered by existing requirements under SASB or EBA P3

There is a significant degree of overlap with existing requirements. These are not always identical in terms of wording and/or methodology, however should provide at least a basis for calculating new metrics.

## S1/S2 Comparison

An initial comparison was also completed between disclosure requirements under ISSB S2 and existing TCFD and EBA P3 requirements (SASB was not compared as it only publishes industry-specific standards). Due to S1 relating to general sustainability rather than specific topics, it can not currently be compared to existing frameworks.

Of 47 cross-industry S2 disclosures analysed, only 3 disclosures do not appear in the above existing reporting frameworks. These are qualitative disclosures – the quantitative disclosures (mainly falling under the Metrics and Targets section) are at least in part covered by TCFD or EBA P3.
